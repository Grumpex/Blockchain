## üåü Highlights

- Simple UI
- Validation and algorithms
- Communication with multiple instances of the application


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This is Blockchain project i've built using a graphical user interface that enables working with the blockchain.
I've implemented validation of individual blocks as well as the entire chain and the creation of new blocks (mining).
The blockchain consists of the "proof-of-work" consensus algorithm, adjustable difficulty for generating new blocks in the network,
Validation of timestamps and cumulative difficulty, Communication between multiple instances of the application.

I've used C# as a language with Windows Forms.

### üõ†Ô∏è Block Structure

Every block has the next elements:
  - Index,
  - Data,
  - Timestamp,
  - Hash,
  - previousHash.
(The first hash will have the value 0)
